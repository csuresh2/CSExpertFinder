PreProcessing
==============
- Offline crawling and processing of information from Web.
  This involves focused crawling on selected few domains and extraction of relevant
  entities from the webpages for online processing. 
- Filtering of extracted data to create "people profiles" and "concept profiles"

Prerequisites
================
- Solr setup running on the local machine or the remote machine
  Download site:http://lucene.apache.org/solr/
  	a. Extract the solr to any preferred location - <solr_location>
       	b. Copy two folders provided "concept" and "people" under <solr_location>/example/solr
	   Note: These folders can be recreated and indexed as and when fresh profiles need to be generated 
        c. START the solr server from <solr_location>/example/java -jar start.jar
           Note: No need to change any parameters if running locally. Just start the Solr 
- If required, make any changes to the CSExpertSearch.config file provided to locate
  the appropriate folders for "people profiles","concept profiles" and SOLR_SERVER http location
 	
Installation
=============
just 'make'

Usage
========
java -cp .:bin:lib/* CS_Expert_Search [-index] [-pindex] [-cindex] [-csearch concept_term1 concept_term1..] [-tsearch term1 term2..]

Note: Perform any of the below commands
[-pindex]  - Index people profile data
[-cindex]  - Index concept profile data
[-index]   - Index both people and concept data
[-csearch concept_term1 concept_term1..] - Find experts based on research concept
[-tsearch term1 term2..] - Find experts based on terms

Example
=========
Note: concept files path, people files path and SOLR http url path should be set in CSExpertSearch.config file provided
java -cp .:bin:lib/* CS_Expert_Search -index
java -cp .:bin:lib/* CS_Expert_Search -pindex
java -cp .:bin:lib/* CS_Expert_Search -cindex 
java -cp .:bin:lib/* CS_Expert_Search -csearch information retrieval
java -cp .:bin:lib/* CS_Expert_Search -psearch time cache segments data

Output
========
Search commands "Concept Search" and "Term Search" will output an result.txt in the current directory
